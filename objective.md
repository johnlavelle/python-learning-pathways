Learning Pathways for Python in Scientific Software Development

Purpose: This presentation provides a structured learning roadmap for DMI researchers
who want to master Python for scientific computing. Rather than teaching Python syntax,
it focuses on curating the best resources, tools, and practices to help researchers
at all levels build their skills efficiently.

Key Goals:
1. Provide clear learning pathways from beginner to advanced
2. Introduce essential tools and libraries for scientific computing
3. Emphasize software engineering best practices (clean code, testing, version control)
4. Show how to leverage modern AI tools for development
5. Connect learners with communities and ongoing learning resources

Target Audience: DMI researchers ranging from complete beginners to those seeking
to improve their existing Python skills with better practices and advanced techniques.

Format: Designed for Slidev (https://sli.dev) - a developer-friendly presentation tool
that uses Markdown and allows for interactive code examples and modern web features.
