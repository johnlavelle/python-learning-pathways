## Pathways to Learn Python for Scientific Software Development

### A Guide for Researchers at DMI

* **Presenter:** [Your Name/Department]
* **Date:** April 7, 2025
* *(Optional: Add DMI Logo)*

Note: This talk outlines practical learning paths, resources, tools, and best practices for researchers at DMI looking to start or improve their skills in scientific software development using Python.

Python is a *dynamic* language, meaning you can open it in the terminal and use it interactively.

... as opposed to a *compiled* language like Fortran.

## Development Environments

You can develop using your favourite text editor, VIM, etc., but there are benefits in using an IDE:

* **Code Completion**: Suggests function names, parameters, and imports as you type
* **Integrated Debugging**: Set breakpoints, inspect variables, and step through code execution
* **Version Control Integration**: Git support built directly into your development environment
* **Virtual Environment Management**: Create and manage Python environments with ease
* **Scientific Tooling**: Built-in support for Jupyter notebooks, data visualization, and scientific libraries
* **Code Inspection**: Automated detection of style issues, errors, and potential bugs

## Visual Studio Code

![VS code](images/vscode.png)

Very popular, but requires some setup: [https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/python](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/python)

---

## Spyder

![Spyder IDE](images/ide_spyder.png)

Matlab like interface, but more limited.

---

## PyCharm

![PyCharm IDE](images/ide_pycharm.png)

Sophisticated, Python orientated IDE. Requires a subscription.

---

## Jupyter Lab

![Jupyter Lab Interface](images/ide_jupyterlab.png)

For interactive code development. Not suitable for large code bases.
