## Best Practices in Scientific Software Development
### Project Organization

* **Project Structure**:
  * Clear separation of concerns
  * Modular design
  * Configuration separated from code

* **Version Control**:
  * Use Git for tracking changes
  * Semantic versioning for releases
  * Regular, small, focused commits

* **Documentation**:
  * README.md with project overview
  * API documentation (e.g., using Sphinx)
  * Usage examples

---

## Best Practices in Scientific Software Development
### Quality & Reproducibility

* **Testing**:
  * pytest for unit and integration tests
  * Test early, test often
  * Continuous Integration (GitHub Actions, GitLab CI)

* **Environment Management**:
  * Virtual environments (venv, conda)
  * Requirements tracking (requirements.txt, environment.yml)
  * Container solutions (Docker)

* **Code Review**:
  * Peer review before merging
  * Automated quality checks

---

## Clean Code Principles
### Writing Maintainable Python

* **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)**:
  * Extract repeated logic into functions
  * Use utility modules for common operations
  * Consider whether repetition actually improves readability

* **SOLID Principles**:
  * Single Responsibility - Each class/function does one thing well
  * Open/Closed - Extend behavior without modifying code
  * Liskov Substitution - Derived classes must be substitutable
  * Interface Segregation - Small, specific interfaces
  * Dependency Inversion - Depend on abstractions

---

## Clean Code Principles
### Pythonic Practices

* **PEP 8** - Python's style guide
* **Descriptive naming** - Variables and functions should be self-explanatory
* **List comprehensions** over explicit loops when appropriate
* **Context managers** for resource handling (with statements)
* **Type hints** for improved readability and IDE support
* **Error handling** - Explicit exception handling with appropriate scope

**Code Example:**
```python
# Clear and descriptive
def calculate_mean_temperature(daily_readings: list[float]) -> float:
    """Calculate the mean temperature from daily readings."""
    if not daily_readings:
        raise ValueError("Cannot calculate mean of empty dataset")
    return sum(daily_readings) / len(daily_readings)
```

## Leveraging LLMs for Python Development
### Practical Applications

* **Code Generation**:
  * Scaffolding new projects
  * Creating boilerplate code
  * Implementing algorithms from descriptions

* **Language Conversion**:
  * Translating code from MATLAB, R, Julia, etc.
  * Updating legacy Python 2.x code to Python 3.x

* **Code Improvement**:
  * Refactoring suggestions
  * Adding type hints
  * Identifying potential bugs

---

## Leveraging LLMs for Python Development
### Best Practices

* **Verify Output** - Always review generated code for correctness
* **Iterative Refinement** - Start broad, then request specific improvements
* **Provide Context** - Include imports, dependencies, and example usage
* **Learn from the Output** - Study how LLMs solve problems

**Example Prompts**:
* "Convert this MATLAB code to NumPy/SciPy"
* "Refactor this function to follow SOLID principles"
* "Optimize this data processing function for large datasets"
* "Explain this algorithm and suggest improvements"
