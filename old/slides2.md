**(Slide 18: Gotcha: Thinking in Loops vs. Vectors)**

# Gotcha: Thinking in Loops vs. Vectors (Pythonic NumPy)

Avoid translating Fortran/C style loops directly for array math. Use NumPy's *vectorized* operations for speed and readability.

**Example: Add 1 to elements \> 5**

**The Loop Way (Slow, Less Pythonic):**

```python
# ... (setup as before) ...
result = np.copy(my_array)
for i in range(len(result)):
    if result[i] > 5:
        result[i] = result[i] + 1
```

**The NumPy Way (Fast, Pythonic):**

```python
# ... (setup as before) ...
mask = my_array > 5       # Boolean mask: [F T F T F T]
result = my_array.copy()
result[mask] += 1         # Apply operation only where mask is True
```

*Leverage NumPy's array-at-a-time operations\!*

-----

**(Slide 19: Using LLMs to Learn Python - Introduction)**

# Using LLMs (AI) to Learn Python

Large Language Models (ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude...) can be powerful learning assistants.

**How they help:** Explain concepts, translate code, debug errors, suggest improvements, generate code snippets.

**Caution:** **Always verify LLM output\!** They can be wrong ("hallucinate"). Use them as assistants, not infallible oracles. Critical thinking is required.

-----

**(Slide 20: LLM Prompt Example: Tutorial)**

# LLM Prompt: Get a Tutorial

**Goal:** Understand a specific library feature relevant to your work.

**Example Prompt:**
"I'm a meteorologist using Python. Show me how to use `xarray` to open a NetCDF file containing 4D temperature data (time, level, lat, lon), select data for a specific region (lat/lon box) and time range, and then compute the average temperature at the 500hPa level over that region and time."

*(Presenter Note: Mention the expected output is code + explanation, refer to optional slide 21 if showing full detail)*

-----

**(Slide 21: [Optional] Full LLM Response for Xarray - For HTML Export)**

\<div style="background-color: \#f9f9f9; border: 1px solid \#ddd; padding: 20px; height: 70vh; overflow-y: auto;"\>
**(Content from previous Xarray LLM response goes here)**
\</div\>

-----

**(Slide 22: LLM Prompt Example: Translate Code)**

# LLM Prompt: Translate Code

**Goal:** Convert code from MATLAB, Fortran, R, etc., to Python/NumPy/Pandas.

**Example Prompt:**
"Translate this MATLAB code snippet for calculating geopotential height anomaly into Python using xarray, assuming 'gh' and 'gh\_mean' are xarray DataArrays with matching coordinates:"

```matlab
% MATLAB code
gh_anomaly = gh - gh_mean;
```

**Expected Output:** Python equivalent (likely `gh_anomaly = gh - gh_mean` if using xarray, demonstrating operator overloading).

-----

**(Slide 23: LLM Prompt Example: Debug Code)**

# LLM Prompt: Debug My Code

**Goal:** Find errors (syntax, logic, environment).

**Example Prompt:**
"My Python script using `xarray.open_dataset()` gives a `FileNotFoundError`, but the NetCDF file is definitely in the '../data/' directory relative to my script. Here's the relevant code line. What could be wrong?"

```python
# Code line causing error:
ds = xr.open_dataset('my_model_output.nc')
```

**Expected Output:** Suggestions about the *current working directory* Python is running from, absolute vs. relative paths, or typos.

-----

**(Slide 24: LLM Prompt Example: Improve Code Quality)**

# LLM Prompt: Improve Code Quality

**Goal:** Make code more efficient, readable, "Pythonic".

**Example Prompt:**
"Review this Python function using NumPy. Is it efficient? How can I make it more Pythonic and potentially faster?"

```python
# Function to review
def process_grid(grid):
    # ... (code with loops operating on a NumPy grid) ...
```

**Expected Output:** Suggestions for vectorization, avoiding loops, using appropriate NumPy functions.

-----

**(Slide 25: LLM Prompt Example: Write Code)**

# LLM Prompt: Write Code

**Goal:** Generate boilerplate or standard code patterns.

**Example Prompt:**
"Write a Python function using `xarray` and `cartopy.crs` that takes an `xarray` DataArray with 'latitude' and 'longitude' coordinates and plots it on a Plate Carree map projection."

**Expected Output:** A function definition using the specified libraries. **Verify carefully\!**

-----

**(Slide 26: LLM Options)**

# LLM Options

  * **ChatGPT (OpenAI):** Strong generalist. *(Add Logo)*
  * **Gemini (Google):** Integrated with Google ecosystem. *(Add Logo)*
  * **Claude (Anthropic):** Good with long context, reasoning. *(Add Logo)*

**(Slide 27: Advanced Level - Why Code Quality Matters)**

# Advanced Level: Why Code Quality Matters

  * **Reproducibility:** Clear code is easier to understand, run, verify (by you later, or by others).
  * **Maintainability:** Easier to debug, adapt, and extend.
  * **Collaboration:** Enables teamwork and building on others' work.
  * **Reduced "Technical Debt":** Avoids the future cost of fixing shortcuts or suboptimal solutions chosen now (the "quick and dirty" fix often becomes permanent and problematic).

*Quality code accelerates science in the long run.*

-----

**(Slide 28: Advanced Level - Improving Code Quality)**

# Advanced Level: How to Improve Code Quality

  * **Understand "Code Smells":** Recognize patterns hinting at deeper problems (e.g., very long functions, excessive comments explaining *what* not *why*, duplicated logic, cryptic names).
  * **Follow Coding Standards:** **PEP 8** is the key style guide for Python. Use linters (Flake8, Pylint) & formatters (Black, Ruff) to automate checks. [PEP 8 Link](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/)
  * **Refactoring:** Improve *internal structure* without changing *external behavior*.
  * **Write Clean Code:** Aim for clarity and simplicity from the start.

-----

**(Slide 29: Advanced Level - Clean Code Principles)**

# Clean Code Principles

*(Adapted from Robert C. Martin, "The Pragmatic Programmer", etc.)*

1.  **Readable:** Clear, intuitive, easy to follow.
2.  **Simple:** Does one thing well (functions/classes). Avoid unnecessary complexity.
3.  **Consistent:** Follows uniform patterns and formatting (PEP 8\!).
4.  **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself):** Encapsulate reusable logic.
5.  **Self-explanatory:** Good naming minimizes need for comments (explain *why*, not *what*).
6.  **Modular:** Break down problems into testable units.
7.  **Well-structured:** Logical organization.
8.  **Clarity over Cleverness:** Write for humans first.
9.  **Be Pragmatic:** Balance ideals with practical needs and deadlines. Choose appropriate complexity.

-----

**(Slide 30: Advanced Level - Best Practices)**

# Best Practices in Scientific Software Development

  * **Testing:**
      * `pytest` for unit & integration tests. Test early, test often.
      * Continuous Integration (GitHub Actions, GitLab CI) automates testing.
  * **Environment Management:**
      * Virtual environments (`venv`, `conda`) isolate dependencies.
      * Track dependencies (`requirements.txt`, `environment.yml`).
      * Containerization (Docker) for ultimate reproducibility.
  * **Version Control:** Use Git\! (Track changes, collaborate, revert errors).
  * **Code Review:** Peer review improves quality and shares knowledge.

-----

**(Slide 31: Advanced Level - Book: Fluent Python)**
