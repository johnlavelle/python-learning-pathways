* **Matplotlib:**
    * Core plotting library. Creates static, animated, and interactive visualizations.
    * Highly customizable. Often used with NumPy/Pandas.

---

**Slide 9: Key Python Libraries for Scientific Development (Domain & Scale)**

* **Xarray:**
    * Brings Pandas' labeled data concepts to N-dimensional arrays (like NumPy).
    * Essential for working with NetCDF, GRIB, and other common climate/meteo data formats. Integrates well with Dask.
* **Dask:**
    * Parallel computing library for scaling NumPy, Pandas, Xarray, Scikit-learn workflows.

* **Domain Specific:** Explore libraries relevant to specific DMI models or data types (e.g., interfaces to weather models, specific data format readers).

---

**Slide 10: Python Development Environments (IDEs & Editors)**

**Goal:** Write, run, and debug code efficiently.

* **Jupyter Notebooks / JupyterLab:**
    * Web-based interactive environment.
    * Excellent for exploration, visualization, and sharing analyses.
    * Less ideal for large, complex software projects.
* **Spyder:**
    * IDE included with Anaconda.
    * MATLAB-like layout, excellent variable explorer.
    * Good for transitioning from MATLAB/R.
* **Visual Studio Code (VS Code):**
    * Free, highly popular, extensible code editor.

    * Recommended for general software development.
* **PyCharm:**
    * Feature-rich, Python-specific IDE.
    * Powerful debugger, refactoring tools, code analysis.
    * Free Community edition is excellent; Pro edition adds more features (e.g., web dev, scientific tools).

**Recommendation:** Use Jupyter for interactive work/analysis. Choose VS Code or PyCharm for building larger scripts and packages. Try Spyder if you prefer its layout.

---

**Slide 11: Best Practices in Scientific Software Development**

**Goal:** Write code that is reliable, reproducible, maintainable, and collaborative.

* **Version Control (Git):**
    * Track changes, revert errors, collaborate effectively.
    * **Use Git for *all* projects, even small ones.**
    * Platforms: GitLab (as used here!), GitHub, Bitbucket.
* **Code Readability & Style (PEP 8):**
    * Use meaningful variable/function names.
    * Follow the official Python style guide (PEP 8) - tools like `flake8` or `black` can help automate this.
    * Write comments *why*, not *what* (if the code is clear).
* **Modularity:**
    * Break down complex tasks into smaller functions and modules/files. Improves reusability and testability.
* **Testing:**
    * Write tests to verify your code works as expected.
    * Libraries: `pytest` (popular choice), `unittest` (built-in).
    * Types: Unit tests (test small functions), Integration tests (test interactions).
* **Documentation:**
    * **Docstrings:** Explain what functions/classes/modules do (use standard formats like Google or NumPy style). Tools like Sphinx can build documentation from docstrings.
    * **README:** Essential project overview (setup, usage).
* **Environment Management:**
    * Isolate project dependencies using `conda environments` or Python's `venv`.
    * Track dependencies (`environment.yml` for conda, `requirements.txt` or `pyproject.toml` for pip). Avoids the "it works on my machine" problem.

---

**Slide 12: Clean Code Principles**

**Goal:** Improve the quality and maintainability of your code.

* **What is Clean Code?** Code that is easy to read, understand, and modify by others (and your future self!).
* **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself):**
    * Avoid copy-pasting code. Encapsulate repeated logic in functions or classes.
* **KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid):**
    * Prefer straightforward solutions over overly complex ones.
* **YAGNI (You Ain't Gonna Need It):**
    * Implement only the functionality currently needed. Avoid speculative features.
* **SOLID Principles** (More advanced object-oriented design principles):
    * **S**ingle Responsibility: A class/function should do one thing well.
    * **O**pen/Closed: Software entities should be open for extension, but closed for modification.
    * **L**iskov Substitution: Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types.
    * **I**nterface Segregation: Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use.
    * **D**ependency Inversion: Depend on abstractions, not concretions.
    * *(Focus on understanding the concepts initially, especially Single Responsibility and DRY)*
* *[Note: Embed placeholder for a short video explaining DRY or Single Responsibility Principle, e.g., from ArjanCodes]*

**Slide 13: Advanced Resource: "The Pragmatic Programmer"**

* **Not just about Python:** A classic book on the philosophy and practice of software development.
* **Why read it?** Offers timeless advice on becoming a more effective and productive programmer.
* **Key Themes:**
    * Individual responsibility and craftsmanship.
    * Tool mastery (know your editor, shell, VCS).
    * Automation (testing, deployment).
    * Designing for change and adaptability.
    * Effective communication.
* **Relevance:** Helps cultivate a professional mindset beyond just writing code that runs.

---

**Slide 14: Leveraging LLMs for Python Development (Part 1: How they Help)**

**Tools:** GitHub Copilot, ChatGPT, Gemini, etc.

* **Code Generation:**
    * Boilerplate code (e.g., class structures, file I/O).
    * Simple functions based on descriptions.
    * *Example: "Write a Python function to read a CSV with pandas and return the first 5 rows."*
* **Code Explanation:**
    * Understanding unfamiliar syntax or library functions.
    * *Example: "Explain this line of Python code using xarray..."*
* **Debugging Assistance:**
    * Suggesting potential causes for error messages (paste traceback).
    * Proposing fixes (use critically!).
* **Learning & Exploration:**
    * Asking "how-to" questions.
    * *Example: "How do I plot a time series with Matplotlib?"*
* **Test Generation:**
    * Can generate basic unit tests (`pytest` format) for existing functions.

---

**Slide 15: Leveraging LLMs for Python Development (Part 2: Practical Examples)**

* **Example 1: Language Conversion**
    * **Prompt:** "Convert the following MATLAB code snippet for calculating the average of a matrix column into Python using NumPy:" `avg_temp = mean(data(:, 2));`
    * **Potential LLM Output:** `import numpy as np \navg_temp = np.mean(data[:, 1]) # Python uses 0-based indexing!`
* **Example 2: Code Improvement / Refactoring**
    * **Prompt:** "Refactor this Python code to be more idiomatic and follow PEP 8:" `def my_func( list_data ): \n  total=0 \n  for i in range(len(list_data)): total += list_data[i] \n  return total/len(list_data)`
    * **Potential LLM Output:** `import numpy as np \n\ndef calculate_mean(data_list: list) -> float: \n    \"\"\"Calculates the mean of a list of numbers.\"\"\" \n    if not data_list: \n        return 0.0 # Or raise error \n    return np.mean(data_list) # More efficient for numerical data \n    # Or using pure Python: return sum(data_list) / len(data_list)`
* **Example 3: Generating New Code**
    * **Prompt:** "Write a Python function using xarray to open a NetCDF file named 'weather.nc', select the variable 'temperature' for the year 2024, and calculate the spatial average over latitude and longitude."
* **CRITICAL CAVEAT:**
    * **Always review and test LLM-generated code.** It can be subtly wrong, inefficient, or insecure.
    * Treat LLMs as **assistants**, not replacements for understanding. Use them to accelerate, not abdicate responsibility.
