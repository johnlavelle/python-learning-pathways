## Slide 8: Scientific Python Ecosystem
**Duration: 3-4 minutes**

Let me map out the key libraries you'll encounter:

**Foundation:**
- **NumPy** - the bedrock of scientific Python, handles arrays and mathematical operations
- **Pandas** - makes data manipulation intuitive
- **Matplotlib** - your go-to for publication-quality plots
- **SciPy** - advanced scientific algorithms

**Geo/Meteo** (especially relevant for DMI):
- **Xarray** - game-changer for multidimensional data like NetCDF files
- **MetPy** - meteorological calculations made easy
- **Cartopy** - beautiful map projections
- **Iris** - UK Met Office's powerful toolkit

**Performance:**
- **Numba** - make Python code run at C speeds with minimal changes
- **Dask** - scale to larger-than-memory datasets
- **CuPy** - GPU acceleration with NumPy-compatible syntax

Start with the foundation, then add domain-specific tools as needed.

---

## Slide 9: Development Environments
**Duration: 3-4 minutes**

Your choice of tools significantly impacts productivity:

**IDEs:**
- **VS Code** - Free, lightweight, incredible Python support. This is what I recommend for most users
- Install the Python extension pack for full features
- **PyCharm** - More powerful but heavier. Great if you're working on large projects
- Has a free Community Edition
- **JupyterLab** - Perfect for exploratory data analysis and creating reports
- Not a replacement for an IDE, but a complementary tool

**Package Management:**
- **uv** - The new kid on the block, blazingly fast. The future of Python packaging
- **Miniconda** - Still the standard for scientific Python, especially for complex dependencies
- **conda-forge** - Community-maintained packages, often more up-to-date than defaults

Pro tip: Start with VS Code + Miniconda. You can always add tools later.

---

## Slide 10: Pythonic Code
**Duration: 3-4 minutes**

This example shows the difference between writing Python like another language versus embracing Python's elegance:

**Non-Pythonic approach:**
- Verbose, C-style loops
- Missing Python's built-in features
- Harder to read and maintain

**Pythonic approach:**
- List comprehension makes the intent clear
- One line instead of six
- Faster execution too!

This isn't about being clever - Pythonic code is:
- More readable to experienced Python developers
- Often more performant
- Less prone to bugs

The video recommendation here - Patrick Loeber's "25 Python Tricks" - is fantastic for learning these patterns.

Remember: "Pythonic" means writing code that follows Python's philosophy of simplicity and readability.

---

## Slide 11: Clean Code: SOLID Principles
**Duration: 3-4 minutes**

SOLID principles aren't just academic concepts - they're practical guidelines that will save you hours of debugging:

**The God Class problem:**
- One class trying to do everything
- Becomes impossible to maintain
- Changes in one area break others
- Testing is a nightmare

**Single Responsibility solution:**
- Each class has ONE job
- Easy to understand, test, and modify
- Changes are isolated
- Can reuse components

In the weather system example, separating concerns means:
- DataProcessor can be tested independently
- You can swap ForecastGenerator algorithms without touching other code
- Multiple developers can work on different components

ArjanCodes' video on SOLID is the best practical introduction I've found.

---

## Slide 12: DRY Principle
**Duration: 2-3 minutes**

DRY - Don't Repeat Yourself - is fundamental to maintainable code.

**The WET problem:**
- Same logic in multiple places
- Bug fixes need to be applied everywhere
- Easy to miss updating one location
- Violates the principle of single source of truth

**The DRY solution:**
- Centralize the logic
- Use parameters for variations
- One place to fix bugs or add features
- Consider using dictionaries for mapping operations

In our temperature conversion example, adding a new unit (like Rankine) requires:
- WET: Creating an entire new function
- DRY: Adding one line to the dictionary

This principle extends beyond functions to data structures, configuration, and documentation.

---

## Slide 13: Testing & Quality
**Duration: 3-4 minutes**

Testing isn't optional in scientific computing - your research depends on correct code!

**The Testing Pyramid:**
- **Unit Tests** - Test individual functions. You'll write hundreds of these
- Quick to run, easy to write
- **Integration Tests** - Test how components work together
- Catch issues unit tests miss
- **E2E Tests** - Test complete workflows
- Fewer but crucial for confidence

**CI/CD with GitLab:**
- Every push runs your tests automatically
- Catches errors before they reach production
- Coverage reports show untested code
- Builds confidence in your research code

The example shows how simple testing can be with pytest. Start by testing critical calculations in your research code.

---

## Slide 14: Version Control
**Duration: 2-3 minutes**

Git isn't just for software developers - it's essential for reproducible research:

**Basic Git workflow:**
- These four commands cover 90% of daily use
- Don't be intimidated by Git's complexity - start simple

**Commit messages:**
- Use conventional commits (feat, fix, docs, test)
- Future you will thank present you for clear messages
- Good messages make finding old code easy

**Branching strategy:**
- main: stable, tested code
- develop: integration branch
- feature/*: isolated development

For research: Consider tagging versions used for publications. This ensures reproducibility.

## Slide 15: Leveraging LLMs
**Duration: 4-5 minutes**

AI assistants are transforming how we write code. Here's how to use them effectively:

**Three main use cases:**

1. **Generate** - Great for boilerplate code or algorithms you understand conceptually
   - Always review and test generated code
   - Use for starting points, not final solutions

2. **Convert** - Excellent for translating between languages
   - Especially useful for MATLAB to Python conversions
   - Check that Python idioms are used, not just syntax translation

3. **Improve** - My favorite use case
   - Paste working code and ask for improvements
   - Request specific patterns (SOLID, DRY, type hints)

**Available tools:**
- **GitHub Copilot** - Integrates into your IDE, great for autocomplete
- **ChatGPT/Claude** - Better for complex refactoring and explanations
- **Cursor** - IDE built around AI assistance

Remember: These tools are assistants, not replacements for understanding. Always verify the output.

---

## Slide 16: Effective LLM Prompting
**Duration: 3 minutes**

The quality of AI assistance depends entirely on your prompts.

**Good prompt characteristics:**
- Specific requirements (mention libraries, patterns)
- Request best practices (docstrings, type hints)
- Ask for tests alongside code
- Specify your use case (scientific computing)

**Best practices:**
- âœ… **Be specific** - Vague requests get vague responses
- âœ… **Request tests** - Helps verify the code works
- âœ… **Verify output** - Run and understand the code
- âœ… **Iterate** - Refine based on initial results

Think of AI as a knowledgeable colleague - the clearer your request, the better their help.
