## Slide 15: Single Responsibility Principle
**Time: 3 minutes**
- "Let's look at a concrete example of better code design"
- **Before**: "This WeatherProcessor class does too much - reads files, calculates averages, AND saves reports"
- "What happens when you want to change how files are read? You risk breaking the calculation logic"
- **After**: "Each class has one clear job - much easier to test and modify"

5. **Common questions to prepare for**:
   - "Python 2 vs 3?" (Always Python 3, Python 2 is dead)
   - "Which IDE is best?" (VS Code for most, but personal preference)
   - "How long until I'm productive?" (1-2 months for basic tasks)
   - "Should I learn Julia/R instead?" (Python has the biggest community)
   - "Conda vs pip?" (Use conda for scientific packages, pip for the rest)

6. **After the talk**:
   - Share slides link
   - Post in Pytroll Slack introducing DMI cohort
   - Consider organizing follow-up Python coffee sessions
